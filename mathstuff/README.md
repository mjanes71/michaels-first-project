# mathstuff

Since you like math so much, I thought we could look at a go project that does some math!

## What are these files?

`main.go` 
This is the file that will have the main code/program in it. 

`main_test.go`
This is the file that will have unit tests for the function(s) in the `main.go` file.

`go.mod`
This is the file to help the project keep track of what modules(imports) we are using

`go.sum`
Keeps track of what you have installed locally so you don't always have to reinstall imports.

Let's take a look at the `main.go` first. Then we'll take a look in the `main_test.go`
